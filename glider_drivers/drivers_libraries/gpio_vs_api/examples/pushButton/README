*
* This code is given with no guarantees and is intended to be used as an 
* example of how to use the VersaAPI software package and to check the

* This code has been compiled and run using gcc on Ubuntu 18.04.03 LTS, 
* kernel 4.15.0-88-generic, with VersaAPI version 1.7.0.  A Linux
* compatible Makefile has been provided with this .c file for an example
* of how to compile this code.

*		make example_cg	=> Builds 'pushbutton' application linking in 
*                                  carrier group library libcgos.so. Used to
